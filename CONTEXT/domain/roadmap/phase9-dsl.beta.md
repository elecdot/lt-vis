This file is a pointer only.

The DSL v0.1 roadmap has been consolidated into `phase9-dsl.alpha.md`, which is the **canonical** spec (grammar, AST with `loc`, semantic rules, error model, UI integration). Do not edit or extend this file; review/update `phase9-dsl.alpha.md` instead to avoid divergence. Agents should ignore this file except to follow the pointer.
